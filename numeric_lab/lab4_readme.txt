Goal
1. Finite difference Jacobian
2. Newton's method
3. Chord method
4. Rate of convergence

Work on Problem 7.

Q1: What happens if you use approximate Jacobian in the Newton method?  Do you see quadratic convergence?

Q2: What happens if you use approximate Jacobian in the Newton method?  Does the convergence behavior change?

Q3: What if you use badly approximated Jacobian in Newton's and chord method?
